## Reporting a Vulnerability

As this platform is designed for **educational purposes** and to study Web3 attacks, we take security seriously. If you find a vulnerability in the platform's infrastructure (not the intentional "vulnerabilities" designed for study), please report it by:

1. Opening a GitHub issue with the tag `security`.
2. Or contact the maintainers directly if a private disclosure is necessary.

Please do not use this platform on production networks (Mainnet) without a thorough independent audit.
